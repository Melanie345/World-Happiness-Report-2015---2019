# World-Happiness-Report-2015 to 2019
This project analyzes data from the World Happiness Report for the years 2015 to 2019, focusing on key factors influencing happiness across different countries. The datasets include information on GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. 

# Objective
To explore trends, correlations, and insights that can help better understand global happiness dynamics.

#Key Questions 
Are the ‘richest’ countries in the world are happiest?
Do trends over a 5 year period indicate consistent happiness or decreasing happiness or increasing happiness?
What countries/regions have experienced the most growth in happiness and why?
What countries/regions have experienced a decline in happiness and why?
What is the strongest predictor of happiness of the variables in this report?
Are people with strong social support system happier?
Does trust in the government impact the happiness score?
